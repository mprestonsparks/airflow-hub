# DEAN Airflow DAG Requirements

## Documentation-Driven Development (DDD)
*Writing requirements first to clarify scope and behavior before implementation*

## Behavioral Requirements

### Given-When-Then Scenarios (BDD)

#### Agent Evolution Workflow
**Given** a DEAN system with configured agents  
**When** the evolution DAG is triggered  
**Then** agents should evolve according to cellular automata rules  
**And** metrics should be collected and stored  
**And** unsuccessful evolutions should be handled gracefully  

#### Population Management Workflow  
**Given** a population of agents exists  
**When** population diversity falls below threshold  
**Then** new diverse agents should be created  
**And** convergent agents should be marked for retirement  

#### Resource Management Workflow
**Given** agents are consuming system resources  
**When** resource limits are exceeded  
**Then** cleanup tasks should be triggered  
**And** resource allocation should be rebalanced  

## Contract Specifications

### DAG Interface Contracts

#### 1. Agent Evolution DAG (`dean_agent_evolution`)
```python
# Input Contract
@dataclass
class EvolutionInput:
    population_size: int = Field(ge=2, le=100)
    cycles: int = Field(ge=1, le=10) 
    environment_params: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    token_budget: int = Field(ge=100, le=100000)

# Output Contract  
@dataclass
class EvolutionOutput:
    agents_evolved: List[str]
    tokens_consumed: int
    efficiency_gained: float
    patterns_discovered: List[str]
    errors: List[str]
```

#### 2. Population Management DAG (`dean_population_manager`)
```python
# Input Contract
@dataclass
class PopulationInput:
    target_diversity: float = Field(ge=0.1, le=1.0)
    max_population: int = Field(ge=2, le=500)
    convergence_threshold: float = Field(ge=0.8, le=1.0)

# Output Contract
@dataclass  
class PopulationOutput:
    diversity_score: float
    agents_created: List[str]
    agents_retired: List[str]
    rebalancing_actions: List[str]
```

#### 3. System Maintenance DAG (`dean_system_maintenance`)
```python
# Input Contract
@dataclass
class MaintenanceInput:
    cleanup_age_hours: int = Field(ge=1, le=168)  # 1 hour to 1 week
    resource_threshold: float = Field(ge=0.5, le=0.95)

# Output Contract
@dataclass
class MaintenanceOutput:
    worktrees_cleaned: int
    disk_space_freed: int
    agents_archived: List[str]
    system_health: Dict[str, float]
```

## Property-Based Testing Requirements

### Properties That Must Hold

1. **Conservation Properties**
   - Total token budget never exceeds configured limits
   - Agent count stays within population bounds
   - Resource usage remains under system limits

2. **Monotonic Properties**  
   - Population efficiency should generally increase over time
   - System resource usage should not grow unbounded
   - Error rates should decrease with system maturity

3. **Invariant Properties**
   - At least one agent must always be active
   - Database consistency must be maintained
   - All created worktrees must be eventually cleaned

## Test Pyramid Structure

### Unit Tests (70%)
- Individual task functions
- DAG structure validation  
- Parameter validation
- Error handling logic

### Integration Tests (20%)
- Task dependencies
- Data flow between tasks
- External service integration
- Database operations

### End-to-End Tests (10%)
- Complete DAG execution
- Cross-DAG interactions
- System performance under load
- Failure recovery scenarios

## Fail-Fast Design Principles

### Early Validation
- Validate all inputs at DAG start
- Check system resources before execution
- Verify database connectivity upfront
- Confirm API endpoints are available

### Clear Error Messages
- Include context about what failed
- Provide actionable remediation steps
- Log sufficient detail for debugging
- Fail with specific error codes

### Graceful Degradation
- Continue with partial success when possible
- Implement circuit breakers for external calls
- Provide fallback mechanisms
- Maintain system stability during failures

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] DAGs execute without errors in normal conditions
- [ ] All tasks complete within defined SLAs
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained across failures
- [ ] Resource cleanup occurs automatically

### Non-Functional  
- [ ] DAGs complete within 15 minutes for normal workloads
- [ ] System handles up to 100 concurrent agents
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 2GB per DAG run
- [ ] All operations are idempotent and recoverable

### Quality
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 90% for all DAG code
- [ ] All failure scenarios have documented recovery procedures
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting cover all critical paths
- [ ] Code follows Airflow best practices and patterns
